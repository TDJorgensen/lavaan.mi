Title: Fit Structural Equation Models to Multiply Imputed Data
Description: The primary purpose of 'lavaan.mi' is to extend the functionality 
     of the R package 'lavaan', which implements structural equation modeling
     (SEM).  When incomplete data have been multiply imputed, the imputed data
     sets can be analyzed by 'lavaan' using complete-data estimation methods,
     but results must be pooled across imputations (Rubin, 1987, <doi:10.1002/9780470316696>).
     The 'lavaan.mi' package automates the pooling of point and standard-error
     estimates, as well as a variety of test statistics, using a familiar interface
     that allows users to fit an SEM to multiple imputations as they would to a
     single data set using the 'lavaan' package.
